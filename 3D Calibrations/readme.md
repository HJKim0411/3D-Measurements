- make_fringe_image.cpp : 'makeFringeImage' function makes the fringe pattern image.  Belows's image is a example of fringe pattern image( T = 48 & vertical ). Also, 'makeFringeImage_gamma' function makes a gamma-corrected fringe pattern image. This is because sometimes the fringe pattern projected by project is distorted by gamma.
